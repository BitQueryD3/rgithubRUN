implementing a deep convolutional neural network with Tensorflow to detect disease from various plant leave images    Generally  due to the size limitation of the dataset  we adopt the transefer learning in this system  Specifically  we retrain the MobileNets   1   https   arxiv org pdf 1704 04861 pdf   which is first trained on ImageNet dataset  on the plant disease datasets  Finally  we

training data  Basic idea behind GANs is  we have two models  one called   Generator   and another called   Discriminator    Generator takes noise as an input and produces synthetic data  Then  this generated data fake data  along with original data from training dataset is fed into disciminator  Here  discriminator tries to distinguish between original data and fake data  As learning proceeds generator learns to generate more and more realistic data and discriminator learns to get better at distinguishing generated and fake data  In other words  GANs learn a probability distribution of the training data which we can use later to sample the data from it  Here  we have two networks generator and discriminator  which we need to train simultaneously  GANs are also famous for their unstable training  they are hard to train  But we have made great progress in this field especially in image generation  As of now  we have GAN models which can generate high resolution realistic images   GANs are so popular that every week new paper on GAN is coming out  This repository contains various resources which can be used to learn or implement GANs      Papers and Code      Generative Adversarial

   What   TensorFlow  https   www tensorflow org   allows  relatively  easy creation and optimisation of computational graphs for a practically unlimited range of  tasks  For each of these tasks  however  one needs     An input pipeline   A model specification   A training loop   An evaluation loop   Metrics      hundreds of other things but I think the point is clear   To avoid the

repository aims to provide a clear template on how to use each of these  ideas in tandem to create a clean  efficient training and evaluation setup       Code  The code contains the following scripts to be run in order      experiment scripts create records py  Creates  x  y  examples of a biased sin  function with noise  It saves these in a  data dir   as sharded   tfrecords   files  Folder for

Estimator  instance for each  loop  Data is read from the  data dir   The model is saved in a  model dir      experiment scripts infer py  Reloads the  Estimator  from the  model dir  and creates a

            79 84        Notes    Only the new Caffe model format is supported  If you have an old model  use the  upgrade net proto text  and  upgrade net proto binary  tools that ship with Caffe to upgrade them first  Also make sure you re using a fairly recent version of Caffe     It appears that Caffe and TensorFlow cannot be concurrently invoked  CUDA conflicts   even with  set mode cpu    This makes it a two stage process  first extract the parameters with  convert py   then import it into TensorFlow     Caffe is not strictly required  If PyCaffe is found in your  PYTHONPATH   and the  USE PYCAFFE  environment variable is set  it will be used  Otherwise  a fallback will be used  However  the fallback uses the pure Python based implementation of protobuf  which is astoundingly slow   1 5 minutes to parse the VGG16 parameters   The experimental CPP protobuf backend doesn t particularly help here  since it runs into the file size limit  Caffe gets around this by overriding this limit in C     A cleaner solution here would be to implement the loader as a C   module     Only a subset of Caffe layers and accompanying parameters are currently supported     Not all Caffe models can be converted to TensorFlow  For instance  Caffe supports arbitrary padding whereas TensorFlow s support is currently restricted to  SAME  and  VALID      The border values are handled differently by Caffe and TensorFlow  However  these don t appear to affect things too much     Image rescaling can affect the ILSVRC2012 top 5 accuracy listed above slightly  VGG16 expects isotropic rescaling  anisotropic reduces accuracy to 88 45   whereas BVLC s implementation of GoogLeNet expects anisotropic  isotropic reduces accuracy to 87 7       The support class  kaffe tensorflow Network  has no internal dependencies  It can be safely extracted and deployed without the rest of this library     The ResNet model uses 1x1 convolutions with a stride of 2  This is currently only supported in the master branch of TensorFlow  the latest release at time of writing being v0 8 0  which does not support it

This repo is a modification of  carpedm20 DCGAN tensorflow  https   github com carpedm20 DCGAN tensorflow         The full credit of the model structure design goes to  carpedm20 DCGAN tensorflow  https   github com carpedm20 DCGAN tensorflow     I started with  carpedm20 DCGAN tensorflow  https   github com carpedm20 DCGAN tensorflow  because its DCGAN implementation is not fixed for one dataset  which is not a common setting  Most WGAN and WGAN GP implementations only work on  mnist  or one given dataset         Modifications  A couple of modifications I ve made that could be helpful to people who try to implement GAN on their own for the first time  1  Added  model type  which could be one of  GAN   original    WGAN   Wasserstein distance as loss   and  WGAN GP   Wasserstein distance as loss function with gradient penalty   each corresponding to one variation of GAN model  2   UnifiedDCGAN  can build and train the graph differently according to  model type   3  Some model methods were reconstructed so that the code is easier to read through  4  Many comments were added for important  or potential confusing functions  like conv and deconv operations in  ops py    The  download py  file stays same as in  carpedm20 DCGAN tensorflow  https   github com carpedm20 DCGAN tensorflow   I keep this file in the repo for the sake of easily fetching dataset for testing

with traditional methods in the area and perhaps also with their methodology  After practicing with some elementary experiences  they can go into the books and study the underlying theory  which serves to guide their future advanced practice and will enhance their toolbox of solving practical problems  Studying theory also further improves their understanding on the elementary experiences

quasi exhaustive list of state of the art publications and resources about Generative Adversarial Networks  GANs  and their applications         Background  Generative models are models that can learn to create data that is similar to data that we give them  One of the most promising approaches of those models are Generative Adversarial Networks  GANs   a branch of unsupervised machine learning implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero sum game framework  They were first introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al  in 2014  This repository aims at presenting an elaborate list of the state of the art works on the field of Generative Adversarial Networks since their introduction in 2014      p align  center       img src  https   raw

offs for modern convolutional object detectors The purpose of this project is to reimplement the following paper  https   arxiv org pdf 1611 10012 pdf    Pre trained Models  a id  Pretrained    a   Neural nets work best when they have many parameters  making them powerful function approximators  However  this  means they must be trained on very large datasets  Because training models from scratch can be a very computationally intensive process requiring days or even weeks  we provide various pre trained models  as listed below  These CNNs have been trained on the  ILSVRC 2012 CLS  http   www image net org challenges LSVRC 2012   image classification dataset   In the table below  we list each model  the corresponding TensorFlow model file  the link to the model checkpoint  and the top 1 and top 5 accuracy  on the imagenet test set   Note that the VGG and ResNet parameters have been converted from their original caffe formats   here  https   github com BVLC caffe wiki Model Zoo models used by the vgg team in ilsvrc 2014  and  here  https   github com KaimingHe deep residual networks    whereas the Inception parameters have been trained internally at Google  Also be aware that these accuracies were computed by evaluating using a single image crop  Some academic papers report higher accuracy by using multiple crops at multiple scales   Model   TF Slim File   Checkpoint
