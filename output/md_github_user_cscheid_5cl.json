R Bindings for the Github v3 API     This project is essentially abandoned  Hello there   unfortunately I don t have time to maintain this project anymore  If you re interested in taking over  send me an email and I m happy to help with the transition   If you re a user of this library  consider switching to  gh  https   github com r lib gh   or  ghapi3  https   github com coatless ghapi3   which are both newer and more actively maintained      Intro  These are bindings for the Github web service API as of version 3  For full documentation  please refer to the  Github developer API  http   developer github com v3        Quickie     ctx   interactive login client id  client secret        me   get myself ctx        me content public repos      1  17       star repository  cscheid    guitar   ctx        unstar repository  cscheid    guitar   ctx       Setting up  In order to use most of their API  Github requires you to register an  application  https   github com settings applications    You ll need to do this if you want to change information  repositories  post gists  etc         Interactive use  If you will authenticate your Github account interactively  using the OAuth dance  for example   you should point the Callback URL to  http   localhost 1410   This is so that  interactive login  works  the interactive OAuth login dancing involves redirection to a URL that is specified in advance   httr  https   github com hadley httr  creates a web server on port 1410 to catch the redirection request and the token that comes with it   To log in  you will need the Application Client ID and Secret  and you will call the following function in your R script         ctx   interactive login client id  client secret  scopes c  gist     This will open a web browser where the caller of the R script  presumably  you  will be asked to type their Github username and password  Give more scopes to allow the bindings to do more things   more on oAuth scopes  http   developer github com v3 oauth  scopes          Noninteractive use  If you have obtained an  OAuth access token  http   developer github com v3 oauth   by some other method  you can pass it directly to  create github context   In fact   interactive login  does little else than securing access to a token interactively  and then calling  create github context    In other words  you should use  create github context  if some other part of your application is in charge of obtaining the OAuth access token   You can also use  create github context  to create anonymous access contexts  You will be able to make some calls into the API  but not all of them  and you will be much more severely rate limited  See the  documentation  http   developer github com v3  rate limiting  for details        About the Github client secret  DO NOT PUT THE CLIENT SECRET ON A PUBLICLY VISIBLE LOCATION  This is equivalent to an application wide password  It is used by Github to track API usage  and could be used to impersonate your app  Store it in a safe location  like a locally encrypted file in your local filesystem   ask the user to type it  or pass it via environment variables from the shell       API naming and style  All API entry points are very shallow wrappers around Github s API  Once you logged in  all calls to the API take the result of web login  Examples         repos   get my repositories ctx        repos   get my repositories ctx  type  owner    The result of all calls to the API is the request from httr  Most of the time you will want the response contents  accessible through httr s  content     This is automatically parsed into JSON  the message format used throughout s the api         me   get myself ctx        me content public repos      1  17  The naming of the function calls is always meant to evoke an order  It starts with a verb and follows with the appropriate objects         evts   get public events ctx        result   is repository starred by me  cscheid    facet         star repository  cscheid    guitar   ctx        unstar repository  cscheid    guitar   ctx   When the Github API specifies  inputs   such as with  blob creation  http   developer github com v3 git blobs  create a blob   you will send the JSON content as the last parameter  named  content          create blob ctx   cscheid    guitar   list content  This is a new blob   encoding  utf 8     When the Github API specifies extra parameters  such as when  listing repositories  http   developer github com v3 repos  list your repositories   you will pass parameters directly to the API call  like you ve already seen above         Get all my repositories  sorted by when I last pushed to them       repos   get my repositories ctx  type  owner   sort  pushed

by copying the template that we have included for you      shell cp    oh my zsh templates zshrc zsh template    zshrc            4  Change your default shell     shell chsh  s  bin zsh            5  Initialize your new zsh configuration  Once you open up a new terminal window  it should load zsh with Oh My Zsh s configuration       Installation Problems  If you have any hiccups installing  here are a few common fixes     You  might  need to modify your  PATH  in     zshrc  if you re not able to find some commands after switching to  oh my zsh     If you installed manually or changed the install location  check the  ZSH  environment variable in     zshrc        Custom Plugins and Themes  If you want to override any of the default behaviors  just add a new file  ending in   zsh   in the  custom   directory   If you have many functions that go well together  you can put them as a  XYZ plugin zsh  file in the  custom plugins   directory and then enable this plugin   If you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with Oh My Zsh  create a plugin of the same name in the  custom plugins   directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in  plugins        Getting Updates  By default  you will be prompted to check for upgrades every few weeks  If you would like  oh my zsh  to automatically upgrade itself without prompting you  set the following in your     zshrc       shell DISABLE UPDATE PROMPT true      To disable automatic upgrades  set the following in your     zshrc       shell DISABLE AUTO UPDATE true          Manual Updates  If you d like to upgrade at any point in time  maybe someone just released a new plugin and you don t want to wait a week   you just need to run      shell upgrade oh my zsh      Magic         Uninstalling Oh My Zsh  Oh My Zsh isn t for everyone  We ll miss you  but we want to make this an easy breakup   If you want to uninstall  oh my zsh   just run  uninstall oh my zsh  from the command line  It will remove itself and revert your previous  bash  or  zsh  configuration      Contributing  I m far from being a  Zsh  http   www zsh org   expert and suspect there are many ways to improve   if you have

 historical reasons  http   en wikipedia org wiki Object capability model   as  object capabilities        Object capabilities  There s a demo of object capability support in  tests ocap tests js  and  tests oc init R   Roughly speaking  in object capability mode  the server involves an initialization function that returns an object  This object is sent and is accessible by the Javascript side    Critically  the serialization process converts any R functions and closures to  opaque  objects  which in Javascript are converted to things that behave exactly like asynchronous function calls  eg    XmlHttpRequest   http   www w3 org TR XMLHttpRequest     These callable objects are known as  capabilities   since each of them is a very specific feature accessible by the remote system  Since capabilities are functions  they return new values  And since both Javascript and R have functions as first class values   capabilities  are also first class in this system  Capabilities can return other capabilities  and so a system can be designed to provide  by default  a very limited set of features  which can be increased when appropriate

see them live  here  http   cscheid github com lux demos    If you cloned the Lux repo  you can find the demos in the  demos   directory  Because of AJAX security restrictions  you will probably want to run a local webserver instead of accessing the files through the file    scheme  files in the file     scheme are considered all as being different domains  to prevent malicious scripts from trolling your hard drive   The easiest way to do this if you run any modern Unix is to chdir to the local Lux repository and run      python  m SimpleHTTPServer 8888  Then simply point your browser at  http   localhost 8888 demos        Development Setup  If you want to fix a bug on Lux or extend it somehow  you ll need  node js  http   nodejs org  and  npm  http   npmjs org   They re used to build Lux  On Ubuntu 11 04 and later  you can say      sudo apt get install nodejs  to get node js  but as far as I m aware you re on your own to install  npm  http   npmjs org    On OS X  I like  homebrew  http   mxcl github com homebrew        brew install node     brew install npm  After you have installed node and npm  chdir to the base lux directory and type      npm install  You should now be able

gives you programmatic access to git in R  through the combined magic of  libgit2  http   github com libgit2 libgit2   and  Rcpp  http   dirk eddelbuettel com code rcpp html     guitar  is meant to be easy to use  with simple classes and methods mapping pretty directly into libgit2 s API  If you have a hard time with it  please file documentation  issues  http   github com cscheid guitar issues  on github  If you really don t like it  you can alternatively use the chorus to Cake s   homonymous song  http   www lyricsfreak com c cake guitar 20026676 html  for inspiration     Although libgit2 has some of the high level facilities of the the git command line tool  most of its API deals in the low level bits  So if you don t know what the index is  or you can t tell a blob from a ref from a tag  you re probably better off reading  Pro Git  http   git scm com book  first  specifically  you ll want to pay attention to chapter 9      Dependencies  You ll need to install libgit2 with shared library support  this is possibly the default for any sensible installation   you ll need Rcpp  and you ll need boost  I like shared pointers   Since libgit2 is under intense development  stick with the development version  it s what I do  and guitar will chase libgit2 s development branch  at least for a while
