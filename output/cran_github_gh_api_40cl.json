These results can\nbe generated using all or a subset of the best computed parameter sets. Among the analyses\nfor model simulation 'sbpiper' calculates statistics and generates plots for deterministic\nand stochastic time courses via cartesian and heatmap plots.

With its state-of-the-art Smart Expression\nTemplate implementation 'Blaze' combines the elegance and ease of use of a\ndomain-specific language with 'HPC'-grade performance, making it one of the most\nintuitive and fastest C++ math libraries available. The 'Blaze' library offers:\n- high performance through the integration of 'BLAS' libraries and manually\ntuned 'HPC' math kernels - vectorization by 'SSE', 'SSE2', 'SSE3', 'SSSE3', 'SSE4',\n'AVX', 'AVX2', 'AVX-512', 'FMA', and 'SVML' - parallel execution by 'OpenMP', C++11\nthreads and 'Boost' threads ('Boost' threads are disabled in 'RcppBlaze') - the\nintuitive and easy to use API of a domain specific language - unified arithmetic\nwith dense and sparse vectors and matrices - thoroughly tested matrix and vector\narithmetic - completely portable, high quality C++ source code. The 'RcppBlaze'\npackage includes the header files from the 'Blaze' library with disabling some\nfunctionalities related to link to the thread and system libraries which make\n'RcppBlaze' be a header-only library.

(2016) <arXiv:1604.04768>, or through the direct subtraction of an estimate of the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator from the maximum likelihood estimates as in Cordeiro and McCullagh (1991) <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345592>. Estimation in all cases takes place via a quasi Fisher scoring algorithm, and S3 methods for the construction of of confidence intervals for the reduced-bias estimates are provided. In the special case of generalized linear models for binomial and multinomial responses, the adjusted score approaches return estimates with improved frequentist properties, that are also always finite, even in cases where the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (e.g. complete and quasi-complete separation). 'brglm2' also provides pre-fit and post-fit methods for detecting separation and infinite maximum likelihood estimates in binomial response generalized linear models.
