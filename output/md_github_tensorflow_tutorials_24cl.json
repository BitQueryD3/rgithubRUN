models implemented in  TensorFlow  https   www tensorflow org    The  official models  official  are a collection of example models that use TensorFlow s high level APIs  They are intended to be well maintained  tested  and kept up to date with the latest stable TensorFlow API  They should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still being easy to read  We especially recommend newer TensorFlow users to start here   The  research models  https   github com tensorflow models tree master research  are a large collection of models implemented in TensorFlow by researchers  They are not officially supported or available in release branches  it is up to the individual researchers to maintain the models and or provide support on issues and pull requests   The  samples folder  samples  contains code snippets and smaller models that demonstrate features of TensorFlow  including code presented in various blog posts   The  tutorials folder  tutorials  is a collection of models

Overview The core  TensorFlow API  https   www tensorflow org api docs python index html  is composed of a set of Python modules that enable constructing and executing TensorFlow graphs  The tensorflow package provides access to the complete TensorFlow API from within R   This set of articles describes the use of the core low level TensorFlow API  There are additionally two higher level interfaces available  both of which are also documented on this website     Keras  https   tensorflow rstudio com keras     High level neural networks API developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation  Keras features a user friendly API that makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models  It also has built in support for convolutional networks  for computer vision   recurrent networks  for sequence processing   and any combination of both    TF Estimators  https   tensorflow rstudio com tfestimators    High level API that provides canned implementations of many model types including linear models  support vector machines  deep neural networks  state saving recurrent neural networks  and dynamic recurrent neural networks   Depending on your application it may be more appropriate to use one of these higher level APIs rather than the lower level core TensorFlow API described here     Example Here s a simple example of making up some data in two dimensions

values for W and b that compute y data   W   x data   b   We know that W should be 0 1 and b 0 3  but TensorFlow will  figure that out for us    W    tf Variable tf random uniform shape 1L    1 0  1 0   b    tf Variable tf zeros shape 1L    y    W   x data   b   Minimize the mean squared errors   loss    tf reduce mean  y   y data    2  optimizer    tf train GradientDescentOptimizer 0 5  train    optimizer minimize loss    Launch the graph and initialize the variables   sess   tf Session   sess run tf global variables initializer      Fit the line  Learns best fit is W  0 1  b  0 3   for  step

any computation until the session is created  and the run function is called     pre   code      MNIST Tutorials To whet your appetite further  we suggest you check out what a classical machine learning problem looks like in TensorFlow  In the land of neural networks the most  classic  classical problem is the MNIST handwritten digit classification  We offer two introductions here  one for machine learning newbies  and one for pros  If you ve already trained dozens of MNIST models in other software packages  please take the red pill  If you ve never even heard of MNIST  definitely take the blue pill  If you re somewhere in between  we suggest skimming blue  then red   If you re already sure you want to learn and install TensorFlow you can skip these and charge ahead  Don t worry  you ll still get to see MNIST   we ll also use MNIST as an example in our technical tutorial where we elaborate on TensorFlow features     Recommended Next Steps Once you ve installed the base

TensorFlow   is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs   The graph nodes represent mathematical operations  while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays  tensors  that flow between them   This flexible architecture enables you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop  server  or mobile device without rewriting code   TensorFlow also includes  TensorBoard  https   www tensorflow org guide summaries and tensorboard   a data visualization toolkit   TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google s Machine Intelligence Research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research   The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains  as well   Keep up to date with release announcements and security updates by subscribing to  announce tensorflow org  https
